The device consists of a Force Sensitive Resistors that send current data to an Ardunio. The Ardunio converts the current into a force value and accurately sends that information as well as the time the sensor was hit to the Raspberry pi. The Raspberry Pi has a screen that displays feedback based on the data from the Arduino.
