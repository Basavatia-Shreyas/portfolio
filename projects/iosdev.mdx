## Scrumdinger
Scrumdinger was my first project with Swift. I learned to use SwiftUI.

The home page allows users to see all their scrums and add a new scrum. When adding a new scrum, users fill out a form that asks for the name, duration, color theme, and participants.

When a user clicks on a scrum from the home page, they are greeted with details about the scrum including its history. From here, users can start the scrum which automatically transcribes the meeting.

## Landmarks
Landmarks is a simple app that allows users to browse their favorite landmarks and presents useful information about them.
